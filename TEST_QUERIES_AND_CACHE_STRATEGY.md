# Test the intelligence and cache behavior of your AI orchestrator

## CACHE STRATEGY ANALYSIS

### Your Multi-Layer Intelligent Cache Strategy:

#### 1. **Cache Types & TTL (Time To Live)**
- **Schema Cache**: 24 hours (86400s) - Static database structures
- **Query Cache**: 5 minutes (300s) - Query patterns and plans  
- **Result Cache**: 1 hour (3600s) - Query execution results
- **State Cache**: 2 hours (7200s) - System and session state
- **AI Classification Cache**: 1 hour (3600s) - AI query classification results

#### 2. **Dynamic TTL Based on Data Volatility**
- **Static Data**: 10x base TTL (highly cacheable)
- **Low Volatility**: 2x base TTL  
- **Medium Volatility**: 1x base TTL (default)
- **High Volatility**: 0.5x base TTL
- **Real-time Data**: 0.1x base TTL (minimal caching)

#### 3. **Cache Layers**
- **Local Cache**: In-memory for fastest access
- **Distributed Cache**: Redis for shared state across services
- **AI Response Cache**: Prevents duplicate LLM calls
- **Compression**: Enabled for storage efficiency

#### 4. **Intelligence Features**
- **Query Fingerprinting**: Prevents duplicate AI calls for same queries
- **Pattern-based Caching**: Caches classification patterns
- **Fallback Strategy**: Multiple cache lookup strategies

}
```

### âš¡ **Level 5: Maximum Complexity (Cache: Intelligent Adaptive)**

## ðŸ§ª **CACHE INTELLIGENCE TESTS**

### Test 1: Cache Freshness Validation
```bash
# First call - should hit AI
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/query \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "How many products do we have in stock?"}'

# Second call within 1hr - should hit cache
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/query \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "How many products do we have in stock?"}'
```

### Test 2: Volatility-Based TTL
```bash
# Real-time query (should have short TTL)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/query \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "Show me orders placed in the last 5 minutes"}'

# Static query (should have long TTL)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/query \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "What are the field names in the users collection?"}'
```

### Test 3: Pattern Recognition Cache
```bash
# Similar but different queries - should hit pattern cache
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/query \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "Count of users by country"}'

curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/query \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "Number of customers per region"}'
```

## ðŸŽ¯ **INTELLIGENCE VERIFICATION POINTS**

1. **Response Uniqueness**: Each response should show reasoning, not just cached data
2. **Context Awareness**: Responses should reference current data state
3. **Progressive Learning**: Later similar queries should show improved understanding
4. **Cache Transparency**: System should indicate when using cached vs fresh analysis
5. **Adaptive Behavior**: TTL should adjust based on query complexity and data volatility

## ðŸ“Š **EXPECTED CACHE BEHAVIOR**

| Query Type | First Call | Second Call | Cache Duration | Intelligence Level |
|------------|------------|-------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Simple Count | AI Process | Cache Hit | 1 hour | Basic |
| Schema Discovery | AI Process | Cache Hit | 24 hours | Static |
| Real-time Data | AI Process | Cache Miss | <5 minutes | Dynamic |
| Complex Analysis | AI Process | Partial Cache | Variable | High |
| Strategic Insights | AI Process | Context Cache | 6-8 hours | Maximum |

Your cache strategy is **intelligent and sophisticated** - it balances performance with freshness based on data characteristics and query complexity!
